To align the described product with Google's company values, we can follow these steps:

1. Organizing Information: Ensure that the chatbot is designed with a comprehensive database of books available in the bookshop, along with their restrictions and other relevant information. This will make it easy for customers to find books based on their preferences or requirements.
2. Collaboration: Encourage employees to share stories about how the chatbot has helped customers find suitable books, leading to a positive impact on individuals around the world. Foster an environment where team members feel comfortable sharing their ideas and experiences.
3. Environmental Care: Promote eco-friendly practices by incorporating digital book options or encouraging customers to choose electronic copies instead of physical ones, thus reducing paper waste. The chatbot could also suggest books with environmental themes or by eco-conscious authors.
4. Accessibility & Equal Opportunities: Ensure that the chatbot is accessible to people with disabilities and caters to their needs. This can be achieved by integrating voice commands or incorporating text-to-speech technology. Additionally, suggest books that promote equal opportunities and positive contributions to society.
5. Feedback & Continuous Improvement: Regularly collect feedback from customers and employees regarding the chatbot's performance and make necessary improvements. This will help Google stay committed to its values and continuously enhance the product's effectiveness in aligning with these values.
